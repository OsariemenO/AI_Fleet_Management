# AI-Powered Fleet Management: Predictive Maintenance

## Overview

The **AI-Powered Fleet Management** project aims to revolutionize fleet operations by leveraging artificial intelligence to predict maintenance needs, optimize fuel consumption, and reduce overall operational costs. This platform combines machine learning models, IoT data, and predictive analytics to monitor fleet performance in real time, helping companies improve efficiency, reduce downtime, and contribute to sustainability goals.

### Key Features:
- **Predictive Maintenance**: Reduce vehicle breakdowns by anticipating maintenance needs.
- **Route Optimization**: Optimize delivery routes based on fuel efficiency and real-time vehicle status.
- **Real-Time Fleet Monitoring**: Track vehicle performance with real-time data integration.
- **IoT Integration**: Leverage IoT data for a comprehensive fleet management system.
  
## Installation Instructions

### Prerequisites:
- Python 3.x
- `pip` for installing Python packages
- A virtual environment (optional, but recommended)

### Steps to Install:

1. **Clone the repository** to your local machine:
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/OsariemenO/AI_Fleet_Management.git
   cd AI_Fleet_Management
   ```

2. **Set up a virtual environment** (optional but recommended):
   ```bash
   python -m venv venv
   source venv/bin/activate  # On Windows, use venv\Scripts\activate
   ```

3. **Install required Python packages**:
   ```bash
   pip install -r requirements.txt
   ```

4. (Optional) **Install additional system dependencies** if needed (e.g., for IoT integration or database connections).

## Usage Instructions

### Running Predictive Maintenance Model

1. To run the predictive maintenance model, execute the following in your terminal:
   ```bash
   python src/predictive_model.py
   ```

2. The model will output the accuracy of its predictions and predict the maintenance risk for a sample vehicle.

3. Modify the sample input in `src/predictive_model.py` to test the model with different vehicle data.

### Route Optimization

To run the **route optimization** script and optimize delivery routes:
```bash
python src/route_optimization.py
```
This will calculate the most fuel-efficient route based on vehicle data.

## Methodology

This project utilizes **Random Forest Classifier** and optimization algorithms to address two main challenges in fleet management: predictive maintenance and route optimization.

### Predictive Maintenance
- The model predicts the likelihood of a vehicle breakdown based on historical maintenance data, including:
  - Engine hours
  - Fuel efficiency
  - Maintenance cost
  
### Model Training:
- **Training Dataset**: The model was trained on historical data such as engine hours, fuel efficiency, repair costs, and more.
- The model uses these features to predict when a vehicle is at high risk of breakdown, allowing fleet managers to make proactive decisions for maintenance scheduling.

### Route Optimization
- **Optimization Algorithm**: A heuristic approach for optimizing delivery routes based on real-time data (e.g., traffic conditions, fuel consumption, and vehicle status).
